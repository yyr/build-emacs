** How to
First make sure you have all dependencies installed on your system.

on Ubuntu I do this for installing dependencies, your system may have
different commands.
: sudo apt-get build-essentials
: sudo apt-get build-dep emacs23

*** usage
- Get this repo
- here is few ways to install Emacs.
: ./be head            # to install from head
: ./be -d head         # build head with for debugging (uses when emacs crashing)
: ./be -t latest       # build latest stable release
: ./be -t some_tag     # for eg some_tag may be emacs-24.1
: ./be -b some_branch  # build from some_branch (local or with remote tracking)

- run git commands in the repo directory
: ./be -g git some command
~git some command~ will be run the repo directory.

For all the options, run
: ./be --help

*** Notes
- uses git commands to maintain sources instead of bzr
- uses mirror from repo.or.cz instead of official (to reduce load on GNU servers)
- Create =bs.conf= for customizing build. (like installation directory,
  configuration flags etc)
- =post-build-hook= runs after successful build (I use it for make
  symlinks)
