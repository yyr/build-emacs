** how to
First make sure you have all dependencies installed on your system.

on Ubuntu I do this for installing dependencies, your system may have
different commands
: sudo apt-get build-essentials
: sudo apt-get build-dep emacs23

*** Get this repo
: ./build-emacs head              # to install
: ./build-emacs -t latest       # build latest stable release
: ./build-emacs -t some_tag     # for eg some_tag may be emacs-24.1
: ./build-emacs -b some_branch  # build from some_branch


*** Notes
- uses git commands to maintain sources instead of bzr
- uses mirror from repo.or.cz instead of official (to reduce load on GNU servers)
- post-build-hook is available for customizations.
